The following notebook will demonstrate how to implement a parameter optimiztion using [ZnTrack](https://github.com/zincware/ZnTrack), [PyEnzyme](https://github.com/EnzymeML/PyEnzyme) and [DVC](https://dvc.org). These libraries/concepts faciliate a convenient way to set up workflows using Directed Acyclic Graphs that represent steps in the Machine Learning life cycle.

The following steps will be implemented using an OOP-based approach:

- Model assignment
- Parameter estimation
- Fit statistics
